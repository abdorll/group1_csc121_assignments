Paul Dietel C-How to Program, Chapter5, Exercise 5.12
Structure and Functions in C

QUESTIONS
---------

a) What is the difference between passing arguments by arguments and passing arguments by reference?

b) What values does the rand() function generate?

c) How do you randomize a program? How do you scale or shift the values produced by the rand function?

d) What is a recursive function? What is a base case?


ANSWERS
-------

a) The difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-argument is that;
   modifications made to arguments passed in by reference in the called function have effect in the calling function,
   whereas modifications made to arguments passed in by argument in the called function can not affect the calling function.

b) The rand() function generates a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to RAND_MAX


c) A program can be randomized using the rand() and srand() function.
   Scaling a random number as an integer value between 1 and N may be accomplished by using the expression rand() % N + 1
   or 1 + rand() % N. For example, 1 + rand() % 6 will produce a random number between 1 and 6.


d)  A recursive function can be defined as a routine that calls itself directly or indirectly.
    A base case is the part of a recursive definition or algorithm that is not defined in terms of itself.
